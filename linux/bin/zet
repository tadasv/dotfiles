# your multicall executable name):
#
#   complete -C zet zet

# Note that you will need one such complete line for every multicall

# Add creates a Zettelkasten repo entry with an isosec unique directory
# name within the $KN/$EXE parent directory. Whatever the effective name
# of the executable (multicall, symlink, hardlink, alias, copy) will be
# used for $EXE. Opens editor with $EDITOR or vim.  Git commits using
# the first 50 characters of the first line (ignoring heading hashtags
# if prefixed) and pushes. Designed to be used in situations where
# commiting and pushing to main/master is allowed (which is usually fine
# for knowledge repos).
